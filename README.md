**The Challenge**

* Using PHP, interact with the open GitHub API to create a basic search tool with a front-end where the user can search for a GitHub account.
* The return data should include information on the user and also list their 5 most-starred repositories.
* The returned data should be presented in a way that is easy to read (i.e. a basic HTML front-end).
* This should be able run as a web application (i.e. could be uploaded to a server and accessible via a URL) - we don’t expect you to actually put this on a server, we’d just like to see the code.

You can use any frameworks, dependencies and packages that you would like to - we just ask that the core language used for interacting with the API is PHP.

If you have time, please also consider the following (implementation is entirely optional, but your comments or ideas on how you could implement this with more time are definitely appreciated).

* Handling rate-limiting.
* Testing, how could this be implemented?
* Version control - if this tool was frequently updated by a team, how would you manage version releases and source code management?
